          Hello! I&apos;m Omer, a software developer who is constantly improving
          myself in the field of front-end development. I work with technologies
          such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS and
          develop projects using the modern front-end framework React. Through
          personal projects and online courses I keep myself updated and
          constantly learn new skills. I love coding because it makes me happy
          to see the websites I design come to life and be used in the real
          world.
